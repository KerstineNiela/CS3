				<h1> Herrscher </h2>
				<p> A Herrscher— also known as a Lawman, Lawmaker, or Ruler— is an envoy, or rather apostle of the Honkai, who inhabit human vessels that are capable of adapting to it, manifesting out of the host's negative emotions. They are powered via a Herrscher Core, which is essential to their entire existence. If the Core is not neutralized when the body is destroyed, the Herrscher can take over another person as a vessel, provided that vessel has the Core implanted.</p>
				<p> Herrschers, as their title suggests, effortlessly transcend human capabilities, are capable of bending worldly laws to their whim and command entire armies of zombies and Honkai Beasts, to overwhelm and destroy human civilization, the goal of the Honkai.</p>
				<p> One Herrscher alone is quite powerful, but against humanity's technology, it often takes more than one of them to actually destroy the world. Additionally, as the Honkai adapts, the Herrschers adapt too. Two Herrschers of the Previous Era were able to bring destruction to civilization with abilities engineered specifically to counter them, while lacking the ability to contend with the destructive capability of other Herrschers.</p>

				<p> After the demise of the Previous Era,the Fourth Divine Key finishes purifying the Honkai corruption of the world, allowing the planet to be habitable again. The surviving Flamechaser carried out their respective missions guiding the people to fight the Honkai.</p>

				<h2> Previous Era </h2>
				<p>The humans of earth reach peak technological development. Thus, the Honkai adapts Herrschers for the very first time on Earth. Herrschers are corrupted humans with immense Honkai Energy, much more than humanity has ever seen or combatted before. </p>
				<p> At last, only the final herrscher is left, mankind sent their 8 best warriors to the moon however, the enemy was more powerful then expected. The best they could do was buy time in order for the reamaining humans to go underground into the cyrogenic chambers.Humanity lost, the final herrscher destroyed everything.</p>
				<p> "No matter the costs, Humanity will purge the Honkai"</p>
